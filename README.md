# Team GIT Workflow Lab

In this lab you will practice following a workflow that will help you to collaborate as an engineering team on joint project that is stored in git.

The lab will walk you through the following steps:


### Team members

For the purposes of this lab, each team member will pick one of the following colors. 

- Red
- Green 
- Blue
- Yellow

We will use each team members color as their name in the instruction below.


### Step 0: Create a project repository for the team:

1. Pick **one** team member to fork (= copy) the [lab repository](https://github.com/ronnebg/team-workflow-lab) to 
   their Github space:
   - Follow this [link](https://github.com/ronnebg/team-workflow-lab)
   - Click on the button labeled **Fork** on the top right of the screen
   - Select your personal github space as the destination where the team repository will be created.
2.  Permission all team members as collaborators:
   - Click the **Settings** button on the just created fork of the project repository
   - Select **Collaborators**, and add all team members as collaborators
   - Each team member should accept the collaboration invitation.
3. Each team member now should clone the team repository to their computer.  In git bash run:
   ```
       git clone <link-to-team-repository>
   ```
